# Synti_DataHandling

The system admin had a problem of updating the status of requests in a short time and at a specific time this used to come.
Also this person was supposed to provision a lot of servers, this was a manual and intensive process. So designed a program to eliminate these issues.            

This repo contains a program to remove invalid data in JSON file.
The JSON file is 'data.json'.
The program file is 'removeDuplicatesNullBlankEmptyFromJSON.js'.
The program removes all duplicate values, null values, blank values and empty values from JSON file.
